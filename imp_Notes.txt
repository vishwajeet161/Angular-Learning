Ways of component Communication

why?
The scenario where two or more components need to interact is known as component communication.
There are multiple ways to achieve the component communication.

there are 3 ways that we generally use :-
Using @Input and @Output
Using @ViewChild and @ContentChild
Using Services

@Input :-
Input is a decorator which is used to pass the data from parent component to child component
we can also call parent component to child component relationship as smart component and dumb component.
Parent component is a smart component which knows from where to get data and child component is a dumb component which does not known anything, it just need to know what to render.

@Output :-

  @Output() selectedRoom = new  EventEmitter<RoomList>();

Output is a decorator which is used to pass the data from child component to parent component
EventEmitter is a class which is used to emit the event
selectedRoom is the event which will be emitted to the parent component
RoomList is the type of data which will be emitted
