<!--We can use all the html attributes like innerText, hidden, etc. in Angular
But if we use hidden attribute, it will hide the element but it will still be present in the DOM (which can cause performance issues if application is heavy)
So, it is better to use *ngIf directive to remove the element from the DOM-->
<div [hidden]="hideRooms">
    Number of Rooms:
    <div [ngStyle]="{'color': rooms.availableRooms ? 'green': 'red'}"
